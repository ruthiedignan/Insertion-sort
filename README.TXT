PROJECT TITLE: 07.09: Insertion Sort
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: This sorts movies ascending and descending in multiple ways.
VERSION or DATE: 02/23/2021
AUTHOR: Ruthie Dignan
********************** P M R *************************
<+s>: I understood how to use the insertion sort method to list movies
ascending and descending, both alphabetically and numerically.

<-s>: I struggled initially with differing the ascending as opposed to the
descending, but it was a simple change I was overthinking.
******************************************************
In the future: I feel comfortable on this project.
